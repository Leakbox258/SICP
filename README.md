what we need is `MIT-Scheme`: An interpreter of `LISP` in scheme dialect provided by Gnu: https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/
Because of the extremely low response speed from Gnu's Server. I cloned a pair of the source code ( `gcc-14` can handle this ) and installation manual of this interpreter
but if you use Ubuntu, you can directly get executable from apt instead of compiling youself.
